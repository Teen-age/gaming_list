    <p class="rgb1">Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games â€” the same company behind League of Legends. <br>
         The game was officially released on June 2, 2020.</p>
    <p class="rgb2">In Valorant, players are split into two teams of five and take turns playing attackers and defenders. Each player picks an "Agent," a character <br>
         with unique abilities, and the core gameplay focuses on precise gunplay combined with strategic use of those abilities. The matches are usually played <br>
         in a best-of-25 rounds format, and the first team to win 13 rounds claims victory.</p>

    <p class="rgb3">The game is often compared to Counter-Strike because of its focus on precise aiming, recoil control, and economy management, but it spices up the formula <br>
         with agents that can deploy smokes, flashes, walls, and even teleport.</p>
